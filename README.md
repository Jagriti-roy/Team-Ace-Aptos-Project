A smart contract for carbon credits and environmental conservation is a blockchain-based agreement that automates the issuance, trading, and verification of carbon credits. These credits represent a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, where one credit equals one ton of CO2 reduced or removed from the atmosphere. The smart contract ensures transparency, immutability, and security in the carbon credit market by automating the process of tracking emissions reductions, verifying compliance with environmental standards, and enabling seamless transactions between buyers and sellers.

Additionally, the contract can be programmed to support environmental conservation efforts, such as allocating a portion of the proceeds from carbon credit sales to fund reforestation projects, wildlife protection initiatives, or other eco-friendly activities. By using blockchain technology, this system promotes trust and efficiency in the global efforts to combat climate change and preserve biodiversity.
